# Kenya Hospital Management

A web-based Hospital Management System tailored for Kenyan healthcare facilities. This project provides a modular, JavaScript-centric codebase for managing patients, appointments, medical records, staff, billing, and basic reporting. The focus is on practical hospital workflows and a simple, extensible architecture so it can be adapted for clinics, county hospitals, or larger facilities.

> Note: This README is intentionally general to fit the current JavaScript-based repository composition. If you want, I can tailor installation and runtime instructions after you share package.json, server details, or database choices.

About
-----
Kenya Hospital Management provides core hospital workflows in a web application:
- Patient registration & profile management
- Appointment scheduling and queueing
- Clinical notes & basic medical records
- Staff and department management
- Billing and invoice generation
- Basic reporting and data export

It is designed to be lightweight, configurable, and extendable for local customization and integration with Kenyan health reporting requirements.

Key Features
------------
- Patient registration, profile and demographics
- Scheduling and appointment management
- Staff (doctors, nurses, admin) management and role-based access
- Billing / invoicing (basic)
- Searchable patient and appointment records
- Exportable reports (CSV/JSON)
- Modular design to add EMR, pharmacy, laboratory modules later

Tech Stack
----------
Primary languages:
- JavaScript (frontend and/or backend)
- CSS / HTML for UI

Typical stack (adapt as necessary for your repo):
- Frontend: React, Vue, or plain JS (single-page or multi-page app)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (if server-side)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB (configure via env)
- Dev tooling: npm or yarn

Getting Started
---------------
These instructions assume a JavaScript-based project. If your repo is a client-only app or uses a different backend, adapt accordingly.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A database server (Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB) if the project requires persistence
- Git

Installation
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Paul-Karonji/kenya_Hospital_Management.git
2. Enter the project directory
   cd kenya_Hospital_Management
3. Install dependencies
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root (or follow your project's config method). Example variables:

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# If using a database:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=kenya_hms

# JWT / auth keys
JWT_SECRET=replace_with_a_strong_secret
```
Adjust these according to your project's configuration files (config, config.js, or process.env usage).

Running the app
- Development:
  npm run dev
  # or
  npm start
- Build (if applicable):
  npm run build

If the project has separate frontend and backend, check the README or package.json for scripts like `client`, `server`, `start:client`, `start:server` and run the two parts accordingly.

Project Structure (example)
---------------------------
The actual layout of your repository may differ. Example:
```
/src
  /client        # frontend app (React/Vue/Vanilla)
  /server        # Express / API code
  /config
  /migrations
  /scripts
package.json
README.md
```
Open package.json to see available scripts and configuration.

Usage
-----
- Register as an admin or staff user (or seed users via your DB/migration script).
- Add departments and staff profiles.
- Register patients and create appointments.
- Use the billing module to generate invoices.
- Export reports for monthly statistics.

Testing
-------
If the repo includes tests, run:
npm test
# or
yarn test

If no tests exist yet, consider adding unit tests (Jest, Mocha) and end-to-end tests (Cypress, Playwright).

Deployment
----------
Common deployment targets:
- Heroku (Node apps)
- Vercel / Netlify (frontend apps)
- Docker-compose to bring up server + database
- Cloud providers: AWS, GCP, Azure

Example Docker workflow (if you add Dockerfiles):
1. docker build -t kenya_hms .
2. docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 kenya_hms

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome. Suggested steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Commit changes and push: git push origin feat/your-feature
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Guidelines:
- Write clear commit messages.
- Add tests for new features.
- Keep sensitive credentials out of code â€” use environment variables.

Security & Privacy
------------------
- Do not commit secrets or database credentials to the repository.
- Use HTTPS and secure cookies in production.
- Protect personal health information (PHI): follow local regulations and best practices when storing or transmitting patient data.
